# Final Assessment Project

A real-time delivery tracking application built with React, TypeScript, and Vite. This project demonstrates modern web development practices including real-time WebSocket communication, interactive mapping, and comprehensive delivery management capabilities.

## 🚀 Features

### Core Functionality
- **Real-time Driver Tracking**: Live GPS location updates with smooth movement simulation
- **Interactive Map**: Mapbox integration with driver markers and route visualization
- **Delivery Management**: Complete CRUD operations for deliveries and driver assignments
- **Driver Management**: Pause/resume drivers and monitor their status in real-time

### Key Capabilities
- **Reassign Deliveries**: Transfer deliveries between available drivers
- **Status Management**: Mark deliveries as completed, paused, or in-progress
- **Driver Controls**: Pause and resume individual drivers
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket-powered live status synchronization
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly interface with Tailwind CSS

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### Frontend Stack
- **React 19** with TypeScript for type-safe component development
- **Vite** for fast development and optimized builds
- **Zustand** for lightweight state management
- **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first styling
- **Mapbox GL JS** for interactive mapping

### Real-time Communication
- **WebSocket Service** for bidirectional real-time communication
- **Mock WebSocket Implementation** for development and testing
- **Automatic Reconnection** with exponential backoff
- **Message Type Handling** for different delivery and driver actions

### State Management
- **Centralized Store** using Zustand for drivers, deliveries, and locations
- **Computed Selectors** for filtered data (available drivers, pending deliveries)
- **Real-time State Sync** between WebSocket updates and UI

## 🚦 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm or yarn package manager

### Environment Setup
1. Copy the environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

2. Configure your Mapbox API token in `.env`:
```env
VITE_MAPBOX_API_TOKEN=your_mapbox_token_here
VITE_MAP_DEFAULT_LON=-52.731372
VITE_MAP_DEFAULT_LAT=47.562465
VITE_DELIVERY_WS_URL=ws://localhost:8080/delivery-tracking
```

### Installation & Running

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview
```

## 🎮 Usage

### Basic Operations
1. **View Drivers**: See all active drivers in the left sidebar with real-time status
2. **Track Movement**: Click on a driver to see their location on the map
3. **Manage Deliveries**: Click "Manage Deliveries" to open the management modal

### Delivery Management
- **Start Delivery**: Begin in-progress deliveries from pending status
- **Complete Delivery**: Mark deliveries as completed
- **Reassign Delivery**: Transfer deliveries to different drivers
- **Pause/Resume**: Temporarily pause delivery progress

### Driver Management
- **Pause Driver**: Stop a driver from receiving new deliveries
- **Resume Driver**: Reactivate a paused driver
- **Real-time Status**: Monitor driver locations and current activities

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### WebSocket Communication
The application uses a sophisticated WebSocket implementation that handles:
- **Connection Management**: Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
- **Message Types**: Delivery actions, driver actions, location updates
- **State Synchronization**: Bidirectional updates between client and server
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation and recovery

### Real-time Location Simulation
The mock WebSocket service provides realistic driver movement:
- **Route Generation**: Dynamic route creation with multiple delivery stops
- **Smooth Movement**: Interpolated movement between waypoints
- **GPS Noise**: Realistic location variance simulation
- **Status Updates**: Automatic status changes based on route progress

### State Management Strategy
- **Single Source of Truth**: Centralized Zustand store for all application state
- **Optimistic Updates**: Immediate UI updates with server synchronization
- **Computed Values**: Efficient derived state for filtered and aggregated data
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage for state mutations

## 🧪 Development Considerations

### Code Quality
- **TypeScript**: Strict type checking for enhanced reliability
- **ESLint**: Code quality and consistency enforcement
- **Component Architecture**: Modular, reusable component design
- **Custom Hooks**: Separation of concerns and logic reusability

### Performance Optimizations
- **Memoization**: React.memo and useMemo for expensive computations
- **Efficient Re-renders**: Optimized state updates and selector usage
- **Lazy Loading**: Code splitting for optimal bundle sizes

### Scalability Features
- **Modular Architecture**: Easy extension and maintenance
- **Service Layer**: Clean separation between UI and business logic
- **Type Definitions**: Comprehensive typing for API contracts
- **Error Boundaries**: Graceful error handling and recovery

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
